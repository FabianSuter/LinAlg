Helpful commands:
* `hugo help` gives you a command overview
* `hugo server -D` runs a local server with drafts enabled, much like a preview of the finished site
* `hugo -D` builds static pages and puts it into folder `docs`
* `git status` calls for the status of your local file, for example to check on untracked files
* `git add --all` Adds everything to your local storage for a commit, such as untracked files etc.
* `git commit -m "text" ` Commits everything to the github site, the text can be changed to a commentary of the changes
* `git push` Pushes everything up to the server
* `git fetch` Fetches everything from the server
* `git pull` Same as Fetch, but also merges it
